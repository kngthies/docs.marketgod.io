## General Suggested Uses

### Which Timeframes to use MarketGod

MarketGod is designed to work across -every- timeframe on tradingview.com - that said, MarketGod is the most effective on the 1h, 4h, 1D timeframes. Other frames include (but are not limited to) the 3D, 1W, 2W & 1M timeframes depending on the traders preference

## What Markets to Trade Using MarketGod

All Markets avialable on Tradingview.com

- Know that I built the tools primarily on Bitcoin vs. USD, because that's what I personally trade. That said, it DOES work on everything from equities, commodities, precious metals, indexes, funds, etc.
  
## How to Proceed When a Buy or Sell Signal Appears

When following an alert you've received from one of our indicators, please ensure to verify its validity by making note of the environment the alert came from.

- Is the market volatile historically?
- How long ago did the alert fire?
- Are we near the higher range of a trading chart and in new territory?
- What time-frame did the alert fire on?

These are questions you need to be asking yourself prior to making an entry or exit into a position.

MarketGod Trading has issued multiple versions of the MarketGod Indicator. They are mostly similar in the process required once an alert is painted on the chart.

> "Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things"
> Eric Thies, MarketGod Author

First off, know that these guidelines for steps taken after receiving an alert will absolutely differ person to person, and that we've designed this to be an add-on to confirm your already established trading process. Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things for two reasons.

1. Increased exposure to market volatility over shorter period of time
2. Increased fees on the market you are trading. 1% over 100,000 trades add up quickly.

### That said, following these outlined steps will likely end closer to positive with profits

Choose your preferred Market to trade. I use Bitcoin-USD but any you prefer is okay.
Once MarketGod is added to your charts, which we discussed above, we also recommend you add whichever indicators are preferred in your normal trading routine.

For us, that includes

- [RSI Divergence](https://www.tradingview.com/script/CaMohiJM-RSI-Divergence-Pine-v4/)
- [KDJ Indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/script/cTQfwzek-KDJ-Indicator-Pine-v4-KingThies/)
- [Bollinger Bands](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/bollingerbands/)
- [Keltner Channels](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/keltnerchannels/)
- [MarketGod Visuals](https://marketgodx.com/free-visual-add-on)

## Tutorial: How to Trade With MarketGod

1. Assuming you're ready to go now, go ahead and set the alerts you need for MarketGod.
2. Wait for the Alerts to fire
3. Evaluate the market when the alert is received
4. Make trade at own risk

## Suggested Uses By Indicator

With multiple releases over multiple periods of time, our indicator has several hundred users who may prefer the earlier releases, which include MarketGod v5, MarketGod v6 and MarketGod v7. These are referred to as our legacy tools, and everybody who purchases MarketGod for [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) has access to them all, along with our accompanying back-test. For new users, we recommend MarketGodx, the primary indicator we promote and have recently upgraded to MarketGodx²

- [MarketGod v5](https://marketgodx.com/marketgod-v5-study)
- [MarketGod v6](https://marketgodx.com/marketgod-v6-study)
- [MarketGod v7](https://marketgodx.com/marketgod-v7-study)
- [MarketGodx](https://marketgodx.com/marketgodx-study)

When trading using the indicator, any input can be used. In the past, we recommended Heikin Ashi candles, although this was solely aesthetic and not functionally significant.

That said, when trading using the back-test, Tradingview highly recommends to use the normal OHLC format as it will be the most accurate for trading in reality.

- [Read this Pinecoders post on the OHLC input when back-testing on TV](https://www.tradingview.com/script/q9laJNG9-Backtesting-on-Non-Standard-Charts-Caution-PineCoders-FAQ/).

While traders can use any they prefer and MarketGod works on all, we recommend the following timeframes for our indicators in order to receive the best results
If you see alerts blinking - it means that the signal is potentially going to fire WHEN THE PERIOD CLOSES FOR CONFIRMATION. Anyone who asks about this needs to understand that the data is in real-time. This means on lower timeframes, you're going to see periods that are open, which price is teetering on the criteria we have set. Rule of thumb: when you see it happening, its irrelevant until the candle closes.

Next, one of the most important concepts to know when trading with MarketGod is that it is local to a specific timeframe, but an alert that fires on a timeframe above your current frame, automatically over-rules your lower time-frame event. This is a key component to succeeding with our tools, as the Macro frame holds the trend you'd like to be a part of.

**Ex: the 4hr buy signal has just appeared. Although yesterday, a sell signal was confirmed on the 1D chart of the same market. The trader now needs to know that the 4h buy is now almost irrelevant or potentially should be ignored.**

Ultimately, we can only do our best to set you up for success and we hope using this tool will get you there and build the confidence it has from us.

## MarketGod v5

For traders who prefer frequent trades and alerts for their given market of preference. MarketGod v5 consists of several technical components and is relatively simple in its criteria, in order to maximize the frequency of the signals given. Note that MarketGod v5 is formerly MarketGod v5.3, which was released on [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) in early 2019. One downfall of it is the inability to manage chop effectively. This causes more false positives in the alerts where there is no change or a quick change to the reverse.

- Any timeframe means any timeframe. Choose your preference
- The higher the timeframe, the stronger the alert. If the weekly candle says 'Sell' and your Daily candle says 'Buy', Buy with high caution, as the weekly will ultimately overrule the signals of a lower frame.
- Wait for the candle to close before considering the alert as true. Especially applies to the low time frames where the technicals are in a tight range and hard to determine in real time.
- Wait until the confirmation of the alert at close of the period. Be aware however, the higher the timeframe, the higher the seriousness and certainty of the alert.-  
- If the monthly candle flashes a signal, it's probably correct, but wait to be sure.
- Heikin ashi candles or normal candles are okay for the indicator.
- For backtesting, always use real candles, not Heikin Ashi.
- [Read why we recommend normal candles for backtesting](https://www.tradingview.com/script/q9laJNG9-Backtesting-on-Non-Standard-Charts-Caution-PineCoders-FAQ/).

## MarketGod v6

Our initial privately offered indicator that built on the success of the once-open accessed MarketGod v5. Like its predecessor, MarketGod v6 is frequent with its alerts, and offers users reliable alerts that can be added to any Market. These alerts are best used on 1h+ TF and above, ranging up to the 1M time frame (monthly = most accurate of all) Rules of thumb for MarketGod v6.

- Any timeframe means any time frame. Choose your preference
- The higher the time frame, the stronger the alert. If the weekly candle says 'Sell' and your Daily candle says 'Buy', Buy with high caution, as the weekly will ultimately overrule the signals of a lower frame.
- Wait for the candle to close before considering the alert as true. Especially applies to the low time frames where the technicals are in a tight range and hard to determine in real time. Wait until the confirmation of the alert at close of the period. Be aware however, the higher the timeframe, the higher the seriousness and certainty of the alert. Ex) If the monthly candle flashes a signal, it's probably correct, but wait to be sure.
- Heikin ashi candles or normal candles are okay for the indicator. For the backtesting, always use real candles, not Heikin Ashi.
[Read why we recommend normal candles for backtesting](https://www.tradingview.com/script/q9laJNG9-Backtesting-on-Non-Standard-Charts-Caution-PineCoders-FAQ/).

## MarketGod v7

- Our long-time favorite for users around the globe. MarketGod v7 offers consistent, reliable results that users can use in any market on any time-frame. Rules of thumb for MarketGod v7
- Any time-frame means any time frame. Choose your preference
- The higher the time frame, the stronger the alert. If the weekly candle says 'Sell' and your Daily candle says 'Buy', Buy with high caution, as the weekly will ultimately overrule the signals of a lower frame.
- Wait for the candle to close before considering the alert as true. Especially applies to the low time frames where the technical indicator components are borderline within a tight range and hard to determine in real time.
- Wait until the confirmation of the alert at close of the period. Be aware however, the higher the time frame, the higher the seriousness and certainty of the alert.
- If the monthly candle flashes a signal, it's probably correct, but wait to be sure.
- Heikin ashi candles or normal candles are okay for the indicator. For the back testing, always use real candles, not Heikin Ashi. [Read why we recommend normal candles for back-testin](https://www.tradingview.com/script/q9laJNG9-Backtesting-on-Non-Standard-Charts-Caution-PineCoders-FAQ/)g

### MarketGod v7 Chop Filter

- The Chop Filter itself is an EMA length that price is required to crossover as confirmation for the given period. This means the lower you set it, the more frequent the alerts and more chop there is involved. The higher the number, the less alerts shown-

## MarketGodx²

### Indicator Description

MarketGodx weighs the probability of a given scenario and the outcome associated to prior events before sequentially weighing the [impact](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SET-IMPACT/)of a probable move by the significance of the timeframe and its corresponding close sequence relative to other TFs, The indicator combines several components of classical [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/technicalanalysis/) and then provides a Buy or Sell alert to traders, which is then acted upon by the user. There are modifications made to alerts to manipulate them in the alternating appearance as the visual above shows.  
MarketGod can be applied to any market, with any time-frame associated to it. The signals relay the alert at the close of the period, and the painted alert is then available to users to see on the chart or even set notifications for via tradingview's alert system. We recommend that users implement marketgod on their preferred time frames for trading, which for us is the 1h, 4h, 6h, 1D and above TFs.

## More Suggested Uses

- MarketGod will inevitably produce false positives. We've taken steps to reduce this but we highly suggest you add this as a component of your strategy, not an end all be all
- That said, please do not feel the need to fire a trade based solely on a marketgod signal, or to every signal it fires.
- MarketGod users should backtest their strategy using OHLC candles for best results
- Heikin Ashi candles were recommended in the past, and we have eliminated the need for them, meaning that traditional [candlestick](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/candlestick/) inputs will yield the highest results.
- MarketGod will always give stronger alerts on higher TF's.
  - Example \#1 - If the 1-Day has fired a given signal and the 30 min or similar fire the opposite signal, know that the overall trend is still likely downward. Same concept applies to all timeframes on this tool.
  - Example \#2  - if the one-month get a signal over the one week it is absolutely worth listening to
- Reset all alerts every release that we put out. Each upgrade will require new sets of alerts to the tool and you were continue to receive the wrong words in future versions if you still have the words from the past

## Additional Customization

Customize the indicator by adjusting the colors in the style pane. Additionally, users can change the plots into labels with the price of close added to them, or a few other label text options, listed in the 'inputs' panel, below the filter adjustments. Users can also opt to turn the strategy orders as well, as this version will have them printed.

Do not follow every alert. MarketGod is not designed as independent trading system. It's primary function is to alert you when a trade becomes potentially available and then you are to use your own strategy to make the decision

THIS MEANS TO ONLY USE MARKETGOD SIGNALS TO CONFIRM YOUR OWN PRECONCEIVED TRADING STRATEGY.

> The only thing that matters when it comes to financial trading is the money you bring back to your bank account. Winning % of trades is irrelevant.

The purpose of this strategy is not to achieve a high win percentage. The only thing that matters at the end of the day, is how much take home profit is brought in. A strategy with 70% win percent and 1% profit is useless compared to a 30% win rate and 10% profit take home. Read the strategy guide below to know best practices for interpreting these results.

## Strategy Testing

This portion examines the [tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) trading platform and the strategy testing engine that enables users to test the historical success and potential revenue generated over a strategy's lifetime. The MarketGod Indicator includes a strategy backtest which users can use in tandem or independently of the Indicator.

1. General differences between the Strategy and Study functions on [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview)
2. How to set the given settings of a strategy to receive the most accurate results
3. How to to interpret the results seen when backtesting a [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) strategy

[Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview).com is an online charting platform that offers a powerful solution and test trading engine for users looking to build any trading approach of their own. Tradingview users have the ability to define, develop and refine their own strategies and they can be applied to all general strategies on [tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview).com and the comprehensive results are illustrative of the success one sees from a given trading approach.

## Studies Vs Strategies On Tradingview

[Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaaiRVEcyw&t=4s)

[Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) differentiates strategies from studies in multiple ways that will be discussed below. If unfamiliar with the topic, know that Studies and Indicators are the same thing. Any Oscillator, Chart overlay, indicator, etc is a STUDY in technicality. Studies differ directly in that strategies are reactive to market environment and variables change given the situation, while studies will be more of a 'rinse, repeat' kind of set-up in which we can generate alerts from in which we use to apply a strategy to.

In essence, indicators are used to READ a market, while strategies are used to PLAY the market.

Indicators can not place orders or cannot be modified to fit a given environment. They will always give the same result at the same time with the same

[Tradingview's](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) native programming language Pine script, enables traders to develop algorithms they can apply as both indicators and strategies. Some users are unaware that indicators are completely unique from strategies and do not imply a given result from a reading or measurement taken. In their own functionality the call for an indicator over a strategy actually leads to almost a different process entirely for defining the price movement and what the intended result is. For one, indicators can establish alerts to be set that the trader will follow and receive on their mobile device when triggered. Strategies however, are limited in this ability and cannot fire alerts.

The challenge is that of the [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) users testing their strategies do not know how to interpret the results provided by Tradingview, which we aim to accomplish by showing specific examples and methods of testing, a standard of practice for our users and all Tradingview users to follow, along with various resources for reading further into this subject.

Some of the examples below are directly from the [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) blog, and resources provided by the PineCoders Community (Tradingview endorsed group & pine script MOD?s\). These items will be cited formally and linked.

The strategy report makes interpreting the success of a strategy relatively easy with its first look as we see above. The initial reporting metrics appear and logically make sense as well. But once we pivot over to the list of trades, [Tradingview has identified 4 components that are specified in this blog post](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/changes-in-the-backtesting-report-16416/)

Slippage refers to the conflict between the expected price of a deal and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage can occur at any time but is most prevalent during periods of volatility when market orders are used. It can also occur when a large order is executed
but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current dictation /ask spread.

### Pyramiding

Pyramiding involves adding to profitable views to take reward of an instrument that is performing well. It allows for large profits to be made as the status grows. Best of all, it does not have to increase jeopardy if performed properly.

### Recommended Candle Type For Back Tests

Normal Candlesticks \(OHLC\) are the only input we recommend using for back-testing any Tradingview strategy.

Non-standard chart types can provide traders with alternative ways of interpreting price action, but they are not designed to test strategies or run automated traded systems where results depend on the ability to enter and exit trades at precise price levels at specific times, whether orders are issued manually or arithmetically. Ironically, the same characteristics that make non-standard chart types interesting from an analytical point of view also make them ill-suited to trade execution. Why? Because of the dislocation that a synthetic view of price action creates between its non-standard chart prices and real market prices at any given point in time. Switching from a non-standard chart price point into the market always entails a translation of time/price dimensions that results in uncertainty?and uncertainty concerning the level or the time at which orders are executed is detrimental to all strategies.

Generally, these are pretty straightforward terms that are returned by the Trading View engine but you need to be able to understand what is going on with the numbers in it to understand how your orders succeeded in your given Trading approach and strategy. Below is an included glossary to reference the different meetings associated with each term when running your strategy and how you can use them to evaluate the performance.

## Measuring The Performance Of Any Strategy

Understanding the definitions of these terms will ultimately add to your general understanding of your strategies performance performance

As you may know by now, back-testing a strategy is a key component in solidifying the base to your overall strategy, which makes the interpreting of its performance report all that more important.

The Strategy Performance Reports appear on the bottom of your [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) charts in the management panel, with the tab location next to the Pine Script Terminal. The report itself contains

1. The Strategy Performance Overview
2. An in-depth Strategy Performance Summary
3. A List of Trades that were entered and traded

Many of these performance details are self explanatory, That said, one of the reasons we wanted to write this guide. was because there are a few generalizations and inaccurate assumptions made about the meaning of a few performance details to clear up. These are items to consider when interpreting them on a case by case basis. Below, we touch on the terms referenced and how they could be accurately interpreted on a general level.

In conclusion, the final tips we have for trading are listed below. This guide will ideally be added to over time so remember to check back from time to time in the event any items have changed.

## Best Practices for Strategy Testing on Tradingview

1. Use OHLC (normal) candles
2.  Always make sure the 'recalculate on every tick' is UNCHECKED in the settings panel
3. Set slippage to reflect the fees you experience per trade
4. Remember that a high percentage of trade profitability DOES NOT ensure the strategy is solid. A strategy with 30% win-rate can yield higher return than one with 70%+. At the end of the day, the ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS YOUR TAKE HOME PROFIT.

# Automation

**Plus Other External Tools**
Automation for our tool has always been the goal. In 2020 we are launching an offering through [Trendspider](https://www.marketgodx.com/trendspider), which will enable users of Trendspider to do so on their platform.
In addition to the Trendspider partnership, we are hoping to ultimately automate the entire process with a bot we offer straight from our site, but at this time, the project is only in infancy and not ready to be shared with our user base. Users can follow this project once we announce it officially towards the end of 2020.
At this time, to maximize your time spent on setting or changing alerts, automating your trading, or just adding more value to MarketGod, we recommend the following tools.

## Why did my indicator not send a buy or a sell when the market price changed? 

If you're experiencing this, you may be using the tool for the wrong reasons.
-If you were confused as to why it has not sent a buy or sell signal, there are two options- 
1. The buy and sell criteria was not triggered for a good reason. This is not a bug and you are misinterpreting the use of this tool. 
2. You can choose to make your own buys and sells without using the indicator. Just now there is a good reason the alert didn?t fire

## What Are The Differences In Marketgod Scripts?

- New users are recommended to use- ['MarketGodx for Tradingview'](https://marketgodx.com/marketgodx-study), published [by](https://tradingview.com/u/marketgodx)
[MarketGodx](https://tradingview.com/u/marketgodx) in the Tradingview public library.
- Each MarketGod script follows a criteria which defines its version number. The main two are highlighted below.
- The tools were released sequentially so each progressive version is essentially more accurate, reliable and performs better than its predecessor (ie. MarketGod v7 is better than MarketGod v6, and MarketGod v6 is better than v5, etc)
- In addition, each "Version" number has its own unique buy and sell criteria from the predecessor. For example, MarketGodx, which was released after MarketGod v7, has a completely different buy and sell criteria than v7, making them completely different at the root.


## A MarketGod Alert was sent to my phone / email but nothing painted on the chart when I looked

This is an easy fix and is typically caused by one of two issues

1. Your alerts are outdated

When we publish a new update, we recommend you reset your alerts entirely. There are tools we recommend to make this an easier process, but it must be done. We ask this because Tradingview does not automatically update the alerts that are already set, when you add a newer version of the chart. So in essence, you're receiving a ghost alert from an older version of MarketGod

2. -You are using a very low time frame and the alerts are not confirmed when you check-
-MarketGod calculated IN REAL TIME. Meaning, the algo fires the signals when the current bar meets a preset criteria. On lower-time frames, this means there are likely calculations taking place that are right on the edge of hitting the pre-established criteria. We do this as an effort to justify our integrity in calculating without repainting. Our recommendation is the wait until the alert is CONFIRMED before evaluating the signal.-

## What is Repainting?

Repainting in the forex is a term that represents the trading platform indicator that repainting, meaning that indicator changes display on the chart as new price data (candles/bars) comes in. A repainting process shows that the indicator is displaying on the chart is highly accurate when it is not.

### Repainting indicator

The repainting indicator is one that goes on changing in its value as an indicator repositioning its line at the point where the current price bar is forming. Such indicators take the help of future data to bring forth the values and signals for entry. In this way, repainting indicators ensure their exit and entry signals in the past look highly accurate and has zero error. The repainting indicator looks accurate on the chart but in real trading, they are not.
Naturally, all [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) Programmers writing in pine-script will encounter questions regarding the validity of a given script, and how it handles repainting.For those who may be unfamiliar, here is the direct definition of repainting [from the Tradingview Pine-Script Manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Indicator_repainting.html)
> Historical data does not include records of intra-bar movements of price; only open, high, low and close \(OHLC\). This leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and in real-time, where only the open price is known and where price will typically move many times before the real-time bar?s final high, low and close values are set after the real-time bar closes. 
> Strategies using ```calc_on_every_tick=true.``` can trigger a repaint warning. Even strategy with parameter ```calc\_on\_every\_tick = false``` may also be prone to repainting, but to a lesser degree. Using security for requesting data from a resolution higher than the resolution of the chart?s main symbol can also trigger repainting. 

## Does MarketGod Repaint?

## Is there a best time frame to use this

[Addressed on the suggested uses linked here](https://marketgod.io/suggested-uses)

## Does the Type of Candle Matter

Not much. All script inputs are taken indepedent of your chart input.

[Addressed on the suggested uses linked here](https://websites.godaddy.com/suggested-uses)

## Which Alert Setting is Best? Once Per Bar

Once per bar is correct.

And if you haven't received an alert on the 1D frame yet, that's because the Market isn't offering any trades MarketGod deems as risky worthy. This is a good thing. View the support item on Tradingview Support links for more info.

## It Seems that my Alerts Disappear Before the Period Closes

As mentioned in suggested uses, we advise waiting until the prior period has closed for confirmation.

## May I know how Eric Thies is using it? The settings, and method/strategies

HA Candles. TF's ranging 1h, 4h, 6h, 1D, 3D, 1w, 2w and 1M. Bollinger Bands & Keltner Channels on my chart, with MarketGod Visuals Tool and RSI Divergence. Sometimes I use the BB% Oscillator

## When does MarketGod calculate its signals

The signals are calculated by the most recent data available to the indicator on tradingview. If your chart is in relatime, it will send the alert in real time, meaning AS IT HAPPENS. If your chart is using signals that are delayed, MarketGod will calculate on the data made available time.

For Automation purposes, alerts and notifications send at the confirmation of the period closing with a given alert.

The different classical technical indicators comprised across the various MarketGod versions include magnitudes of various oscillators mainly comprised of MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Ichimoku, Gann Trend Analysis, Wyckoff Accum/Distribution Laws, Fibonacci calculated support/resistances, and more.

## Which Version Should I Use

New Users are recommended to Use MarketGodx for Tradingview, which you can find by searching "MarketGodx" In the public indicator library. This will be version MarketGodx² when added to your chart.

## The Lock on My Indicator Access is Still Red

Still try adding the tools after refreshing the browser. The red lock updates once you've accessed a tool, not just gained access to it.

## Why are my labels only showing up on part of the chart?

Seeing this or something similar below on your charts? It may happen when switching between 'plots' and 'labels' due to trading view's limitation on labels  that are allowed on a given chart.

Simply put, the more authors with visuals on charts takes more server space and creates slower environments for users. So they limit the visuals to keep the servers as fast as traders need.

To solve this, we recommend changing the time frame, zooming in, or reducing the frequency in alerts by changing the filter settings to a higher number. You may also replace the label options with normal plots again.

## Can I use these indicators with a Free Tradingview account

You can use all of our indicators with a free account, but keep in mind, with a free account you can only set up one live alert and only have up to three indicators on your chart active at one time. With a Pro account, you can set up multiple alerts and have up to 10 indicators on your chart at one time. I recommend a PRO+ account which will give you more than enough alerts and indicators on your chart. You can view the [Tradingview membership options here](https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/)

## Do you have indicators coded for MT4

Our indicators only work on TradingView at the moment. There are some plans to code them for MT4 and MT5 but we don't have an ETA on that. 

What a lot of traders do is chart their trades with our indicators on TradingView and then place their trades on MT4. This is a very popular and preferred method since TradingView is known to have the best charting platform for Crypto, Stocks, and Forex and MT4 is well known for it's fast and easy trade execution platform.

## Why is the Admin in the Discord Group Non-Responsive

Our team chooses to be less involved. This is not a trading group, or premium paid group in which the admin needs to be involved. This is a product, and was purchased.. Questions that are asked will be answered if they are

1. Unasked, or un-addressed elsewhere in the group
2. New problems or issues that need a response.
